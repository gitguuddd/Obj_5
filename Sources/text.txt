“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore with his
hands outstretched, his teeth bared.
“I said no!” shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of
light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ramparts and staggered, looking furious. Harry’s heart was hammering
so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing
there, imprisoned by Dumbledore’s spell — if he could only move,
he could aim a curse from under the cloak —

woman, but at that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst
open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his
hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped
against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged
werewolf, and Malfoy.
“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said the lumpy Amycus, whose
eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, “the boy doesn’t
seem able —”
But somebody else had spoken Snape’s name, quite softly.
“Severus . . .”
The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading.
Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy
roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a
word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.

Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.
“Severus . . . please . . .”
Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.
